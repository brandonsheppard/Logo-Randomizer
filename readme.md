# Logo Randomizer

This is some quick Javascript which will change your pages logo every second to one of the dummy logos @celestinetanlim designed, useful for testing your website theme with various different logo styles and dimensions.

To use it, simply include `main.js` on your site, or copy the source into your browsers console. If you're not developing a Neto theme, you'll probably have to change the selector (from `.logo` to something else).
